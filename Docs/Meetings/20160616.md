# Morphogenesis - Meeting 16/06/2016

## Brainstorming

* explain idea (cf wikis)
(concepts etc)

* Jesus : geomorphology. // ecology.
* Moriah : common def not possible ? -> common properties.
* Lars : phylosophical
* compare different approaches. geomorphology : self-organization.
* Emanuele : different kind of morphogenesis show same patterns.
* information flows fundamental to morphogenesis ? ex. mutual info. but not only. particle communicates ?
* what distinguish morphigenesis from other dynamical systems ? philosophical Q to answer ?
* try to transfer concepts from one field to the other.

* defs : changes of form. difference with self-organization ?

* link between self-organizing organism and its boundaries, its environment.

* depends on the scale. dependence, network. well-defined org.

* **even in bio different definitions depending on the system.** -> huge epistmo flow.

* change scale for self-assembling robots. algo that can cause self-assembly : notion of programmation : // ADN, is it a program in the same way ?

* Fields :
   - developmental bio
   - urban and geo
   - info theory, a. life
   - physical systems ?

* Daniel : local decreases in entropy : link with Information flows.

* can be at any scale but no sense.

* models ?

* debate on epistemo : is it only the start, is it difficult ?

* datasets ? -> verify common measures. (as info flows)

* literature reviews. : already a big thing.
