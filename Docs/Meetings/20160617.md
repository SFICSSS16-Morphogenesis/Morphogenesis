# Meeting SFI

## Ideas

anyway need a literature review. then doable to do an epistemology. compare reviews.
-> surely things that will percolate between fields.

* nobody really knows what morpho is. (in bio depends on organisms). Q of genericity/mechanisms-specific.

How many fields ? 4 is already good, look at different fields.

* historical vision of the concept.

do first the literature review, gather concepts, think. then see later if time to apply to a particular system.
